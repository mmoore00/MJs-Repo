The World's Greatest TODO App is a project that works to improve flexibility and organization of task distribution
within the professional software engineering world. Allowing both team members and supervisors to add and adjust
tasks, export a task timeline to Google Calendar, and tracking the time spent on tasks is some of what The World's
Greatest TODO App plans to offer.
